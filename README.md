## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have the following:

* [AWS Account](https://github.com/AnithaPadmanaban04/Getting-Started-with-Terraform.git): If you don't have one, create an AWS account at aws.amazon.com
* [Terraform Environment](https://github.com/AnithaPadmanaban04/Getting-Started-with-Terraform.git)
* [AWS CLI](https://github.com/AnithaPadmanaban04/Getting-Started-with-Terraform.git): Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface with appropriate permissions to interact with AWS services. 
* Static Website Content: Prepare the content you want to host, typically HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
